Copy a website's home page ( react / css / javascript / )

I wan't you to copy a website's home page. (Home page only)\
\
     Condition/rules

1. non repeated dry clean css code ( Check the css example file)\
I wan't you to use the --global-- section as much as you can, \
and add any to the global section if needed. (but must be specific and readable)\
All custom css must be created in a separate file with the component.js file in the component file.\
You also have a media section for global purposes but can add media in custom css files.\
Try to use and add to the global as much as possible. \
Please keep your css clean and DRY!!!!\

2. Use the least components possible. (this is just the basics...)\

3. Make the page responsive. \
I gave you the website, so you should be able to know all the size ratio the web page responds to.\
Website should change accordingly to all the sizes.\

4. Animations should be made with framer motion.\

5. Copy the text and img from the url.\
